A class is a cookie cutter and there bulit in ones that u can create an integer and datatypes

In Python, a class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects (specific instances of the class). It allows you to group related data and functions together. Think of it like a "cookie cutter" that shapes objects in a consistent way.

Creating a Class
To create a class, you use the class keyword followed by the class name. Inside the class, you can define:

Attributes: Variables that hold data for each object.
Methods: Functions that define actions or behaviors for the object.

class Dog:
    # Constructor method (special method that runs when creating an object)
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name   # Attribute
        self.breed = breed # Attribute

    # Method that defines a behavior
    def bark(self):
        print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

# Create an object (instance) of the Dog class
my_dog = Dog("Rex", "Golden Retriever")

# Access attributes
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Rex

# Call the bark method
my_dog.bark()       # Output: Rex says woof!

__init__(self): This is the constructor. It runs when you create a new object and sets up initial values (attributes).
self: This refers to the current instance of the class, allowing access to its attributes and methods.
Objects: You can create multiple objects from the same class, each with its own data.
Why Use Classes?
Classes help you organize your code, group related functionality, and reuse code easily. They're essential in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modeling real-world things (like dogs, cars, etc.).
