### Linked List Structure Overview

In a linked list:

- **Head**: Points to the first node in the list.
- **Tail**: Points to the last node in the list and its `next` attribute is set to `None`, indicating the end of the list.
- Each node in the list contains:
  - A **value**, representing the data stored in the node.
  - A **next pointer**, which points to the next node in the list or `None` if it's the last node.

The nodes in the list are connected through these **pointers**, and each node's memory address is referenced via its `next` pointer.

### Understanding Big O Notation in Linked Lists

Let’s consider the following linked list: `11 -> 2 -> 23 -> 7`.

If we want to add a new number, say `4`, to the list, it will be added at the tail, making the list look like this:

`11 -> 2 -> 23 -> 7 -> 4`
In this case, `4` becomes the new **tail** of the list.

#### Operations and Time Complexity:

- **Removing a node**: If we need to remove `4`, we first need to find it, which involves **iterating** through the list. In the worst case, this requires checking each node until we reach the desired node, resulting in a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.

- **Adding a node**: Adding a new node involves updating the `next` pointer of the current tail to point to the new node and then updating the `tail` pointer itself. This is generally **O(1)** if we have a direct reference to the tail, but if we need to find the tail first, it could take **O(n)**.

### Linked List "Under the Hood"

When we **append** an item to a linked list, we are essentially adding a new node to the list and adjusting pointers to maintain the linked structure.

- **Nodes** are created with a **value** and a **pointer (next)**, which links them to the next node in the list. You can think of each node as a dictionary-like structure:

```python
{
    "value": 4,
    "next": None  # This will point to the next node or None if it’s the last node
}
```

Each node is connected to the next via its `next` pointer, forming a chain of nodes. This can be thought of as a series of **nested dictionaries** where each node contains both its value and the reference to the next node.

### Constructor for Linked List

In a linked list implementation, we typically use two classes:
1. **Node class**: Represents an individual node with a value and a next pointer.
2. **LinkedList class**: Manages the list and provides methods for adding, removing, and printing nodes.

Here’s an example of a basic **Node** class constructor:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value  # Store the value
        self.next = None    # Reference to the next node (initially None)
```

For the **LinkedList** class, we often initialize the `head` and `tail` pointers to refer to the first node, and track the length of the list.

### Printing the Linked List

To print the contents of the linked list, we can define a `print_list()` method that starts at the `head` and traverses the list until it reaches the end:

```python
def print_list(self):
    temp = self.head  # Start from the head of the list
    while temp is not None:
        print(temp.value)  # Print the value of the current node
        temp = temp.next  # Move to the next node
```

---

### Correct Implementation of the `appendtolist` Method

The `appendtolist` method is used to add a new node at the end of the linked list. Here's how you can implement it:

1. **Create a new node** with the provided value.
2. **Attach the new node** to the current tail's `next` pointer.
3. **Update the tail** of the list to point to the new node.
4. **Increment the length** of the list by 1.

```python
def appendtolist(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)  # Step 1: Create a new node

    if self.tail:  # If the list is not empty
        self.tail.next = new_node  # Step 2: Attach the new node to the tail
        self.tail = new_node  # Step 3: Update the tail to the new node
    else:  # If the list is empty, both head and tail will point to the new node
        self.head = self.tail = new_node

    self.length += 1  # Step 4: Increment the length of the list
```

---

### Summary of Linked List Operations:
- **Appending an item**: Create a new node, update the tail's `next` pointer, and set the new node as the new tail.
- **Removing an item**: Find the node, adjust the previous node's `next` pointer, and de-reference the removed node.
- **Accessing nodes**: Nodes are accessed by following the `next` pointers starting from the head.

Each operation's time complexity is typically **O(n)** for search and **O(1)** for direct access (insertion or removal at the head or tail).
